# Adventcalendar
A nice little advent calendar written with [redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux).


## Development/Test

For hot reloading I recommend installing the [better vagrant/rsync plugin](https://github.com/smerrill/vagrant-gatling-rsync).

```
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
cd app
npm test:watch
```
